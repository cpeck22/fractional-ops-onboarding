# 📄 PDF Generation & Zapier Integration

## Overview

When a client submits their questionnaire, the app now:

1. ✅ Sends data to Octave (existing functionality)
2. ✅ **Generates a PDF** with all questions and answers
3. ✅ **Sends the PDF to Zapier** webhook for delivery to Monday.com

---

## 🎯 Features

### PDF Generation
- **Automatic**: PDF is generated on questionnaire submission
- **Formatted**: Clean, structured format with all 25 questions
- **Includes Metadata**: Client's email and company name at the top
- **Proper Filename**: `RevOps_Onboarding_<CompanyName>_<ClientEmail>.pdf`

### Zapier Integration
- **Webhook Delivery**: PDF is sent via HTTP POST to your Zapier webhook
- **Non-Blocking**: If Zapier fails, Octave integration still succeeds
- **Metadata Included**: Email, company name, and filename sent alongside PDF

---

## 📋 PDF Document Format

The generated PDF includes:

```
<Client's Email Address>
<Company Name>

Question 1: Company Name*
<Answer>

Question 2: Company Domain
<Answer>

... (all 25 questions with answers)
```

All questions from the questionnaire are included in order:
- **Company Information** (Questions 1-2)
- **Basic Information** (Questions 3-11)
- **ICP - Ideal Customer Profile** (Questions 12-18)
- **Social Proof** (Questions 19-21)
- **Call to Action** (Questions 22-25)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Generating

**Issue**: PDF generation fails
**Solution**: 
- Check that jsPDF is installed: `npm list jspdf`
- Verify questionnaire data is complete
- Check console for error messages

### Zapier Webhook Failing

**Issue**: Zapier returns 404 or error
**Solution**:
- Verify `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` is correct in `.env.local`
- Test the webhook URL directly with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/xxxxx/yyyyy/ \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"test": "data"}'
  ```
- Check Zapier dashboard for webhook status

### File Not Appearing in Monday.com

**Issue**: Webhook works but file doesn't upload
**Solution**:
- Check Zapier action configuration
- Verify Monday.com permissions
- Test with smaller PDF file
- Check Monday.com board has file column

### Environment Variable Not Found

**Issue**: `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` not configured error
**Solution**:
- Create `.env.local` file in project root
- Add: `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=your-webhook-url`
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- For production: Add to Vercel environment variables
